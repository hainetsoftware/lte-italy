# lte-italy

Some months ago I found out [LTE Italy](lteitaly.it)... and now I'm into the community! I started uploading images of [BTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_transceiver_station).     
I also update some of them (like modifying the [band](https://www.cablefree.net/wirelesstechnology/4glte/5g-frequency-bands-lte/) that a BTS operate into to).     
If you want to help me into the 'road trip' I'm doing with that website, you could open an [issue](https://github.com/hainetsoftware/lte-italy/issues).
TYSM for the support!




Find us on LTE Italy!~
